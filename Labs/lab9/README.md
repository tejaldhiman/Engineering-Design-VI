# Lab 9 

## Yang

## Instructions
1. Install `pyang` and `plantuml`
2. Copy `intrusiondetection.yang` into the `~/demo` directory
3. Use `pyang` to convert the YANG file to:
   - `intrusiondetection.yin`
   - `intrusiondetection.uml`
4. Run `PlantUML` to generate the `intrusiondetection.png` diagram
5. Open the image

## Installing Pyang and Plantuml

![install plantuml](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8aaf2d62-edeb-47e8-befc-d61519f4cd27)


## .yin and .yang
> Using pyang, I was able to generate .yin and .uml files

## Generate PNG
> Using plantuml, I was able to generate an png image that I could open

## Conclusion
In this lab, I learned how to convert a YANG file into different formats using `pyang` and create a visual diagram with `PlantUML`.
I also practiced using the terminal in WSL and saw how a network model can be turned into a visual chart.
