# Lab 3  — Python

## Objective
This lab focused on using the macOS terminal to run Python scripts that interact with date, time, location, system performance, and environmental data. It introduced basic command-line Python operations, package management, and examples of retrieving information and system monitoring.

---

## Instructions

1. Open the **macOS Terminal**.
2. install python packages: jdcal, astral, geopy (I used a virtual environment in my terminal)
3. Run the following commands:
cd ~/iot, cd *3, python3 julian.py, python3 date_example.py, python3 datetime_example.py, python3 time_example.py, python3 sun.py "New York", python3 moon.py, python3 coordinates.py "Samuel C. Williams Library", python3 address.py "40.74480675, -74.02532861159351", python3 cpu.py, python3 battery.py, python3 documentstats.py document.txt
4. Document the output and include screenshots.
5. Reflect on the use of each command.
## Command Outputs & Explanations

## 'installing jdcal, astral, geopy'

### `cd ~/iot`
> Navigates to the "iot" folder located in your home directory.

### `cd *3`
> Changes into a folder whose name matches a pattern ending with "3."

### `python3 julian.py`
> Executes a Python script that calculates Julian dates.

### `python3 date_example.py`
>Runs a Python program that demonstrates working with dates.

### `python3 datetime_example.py`
>Launches a script showing how to manage dates and times together.

### `python3 time_example.py`
> Runs a script that demonstrates how to use Python’s time functions.

### `python3 sun.py "New York"`
> Retrieves sunrise and sunset times for New York using a Python script.

### `python3 moon.py`
> Displays the current moon phase and lunar data through a script.

### `python3 coordinates.py "Samuel C. Williams Library"`
> Finds the latitude and longitude of the Samuel C. Williams Library.

### `python3 address.py "40.74480675, -74.02532861159351"`
> Converts GPS coordinates into a readable address using a Python script.

### `python3 cpu.py`
> Shows current CPU usage and performance details.

### `python3 battery.py`
> Displays the battery level and charging status.

### `python3 documentstats.py document.txt`
> Analyzes "document.txt" and reports word count, character count, and other statistics.

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I was able to build upon my terminal skills by learning how to run Python scripts directly from the macOS terminal. I gained experience working with programs that retrieve system information, calculate dates and times, and access location-based data. This lab helped me become more comfortable using Python alongside the command line, and showed me how terminal-based scripting can automate useful tasks in development and system monitoring.
