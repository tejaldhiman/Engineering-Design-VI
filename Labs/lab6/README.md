## Running hello-world.js
> After navigating to iot lesson 6, I ran 'node hello-world.js'
> at browser http://127.0.0.1:3000 I could see the running server.

## Running hello.js
> I quit the other server testing and ran the command 'node hello.js.'
> Found the running server at http://127.0.0.1:8080 and when I went to the address, the terminal updated as well.

## Running http.js
> Next I ran the command 'node http.js'.
> When I refreshed the web page, the server updated and it reflected on the page.
> Similarly, starting from 0, the terminal also updated each time the page was refreshed.

## Running say_hello.py
> Used command 'python3 say_hello.py'

## Conclusion
 In this lab I learned to run server JavaScript using Node.js and to view the results in a web browser.
 I then tested three different files of 'helo-world.js', 'hello.js', and 'http.js' to see how both the web page and the terminal responded when I visited the corresponding link. I then installed pystache and ran 'say_hello.py' to render content from a .mustache template. This lab helped me understand how web servers and templates work.
