# Lab 10 

## Blockchain

### Instructions
1. Navigate to the Lesson 10 directory  
2. Run the hash test script twice and observe
3. Execute the basic blockchain script to display chained blocks   
4. Start the SnakeCoin Flask server  
6. In a second terminal, submit a blockchain transaction  
7. Mine a new block to record the transaction  
8. Clone the blockchain web app from GitHub  
9. Open a browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, post a message, click “Request to mine,” then “Resync” to view the new block

## Hash and Blockchain
> First I verified hash of same value changes with randomness.
> Then printed a block chain and verified it.
> Launched server and it ran on http://127.0.0.1:5000
> Finally, I sent a transaction and mined the block

## Web App
> Frist step was cloning the github app.
> I edited nano node_server to auto run the server.
> I ran the server and then posted and mined the content

## Conclusion
Through this lab, I learned how hashing and block chaining work in Python. I ran a blockchain REST API server and submitted/verified transactions.
I then built a decentralized Flask web app and mined user-submitted posts using curl, Flask servers, and modular blockchain components.
> I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.
