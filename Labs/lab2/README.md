## Conclusion
Through this lab I was able to learn and explore alot of basic terminal commands for Mac OS. I'm now able to find important information about the system processes on my laptop and about the laptop, as well as becoming more comfotable using the terminal to navigate and use directories wtih these commands. 

> I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.
